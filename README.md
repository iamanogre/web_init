# web_init
Starts up your favorite websites upon initialization. Add your websites to websites.txt and then the executable (as a shortcut) into your shortcuts folder. Could have multiple slots (but so far only default - 0 and leisure - 1).
The awesome part is that your can add your websites to the text file and then your executable shortcut will still be good to go.

Note: to compile (I'll change the names later) gcc test.c -o test.exe and then ./test.exe

Disclaimer: Runs only on windows (cause I have a windows), but I'm not sure if it'll work on other systems the same way after you do minor changing.

# Use
Now has an infinite loop and stays open if you want to look up your default sites and now another text page you can add to for leisure - all right there! You can add more if you like, but it will require necessity of putting it all in.
